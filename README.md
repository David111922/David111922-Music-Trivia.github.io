# Music Trivia Game

## Description
 This is a fun and interactive music trivia game which primarily deals with popular vocalists , duos, and bands from the 20th century. As a musician myself,
 I found this a topic close to my heart.
 Along with tallying the player's score there is an option of playing the 
 song related to the correct answers via a youtube link.

 ## Game Logic

 The game starts with the opening of a curtain that initiates the beginning of the game. Underneath the neon message "You are what you listen to will be an initial
 question on general knowledge of music. In the preceding vertical block the player will have four answers to choose from. If the user answers incorrectly the game
 will automatically go to the next question. On the very bottom there is a score section. The score will remain the same. If the player answers correctly the score
 will increment by 1. There will be a pop up with a congratulatory message and an option of playing a related youtube link. If the user chooses to play the link. he or
 she simply closes the link and the game will continue to the subsequent question. There is an oval start over button  which allows the player to try again. Once 
 the final question is answered there will be a game over message with the final score.

 ### Post-MVP Plans

I would like to close the curtains when the game ends and have some applause.
Possibly adding a previous question option is something that that user might appreciate.
Adding mp3 links is something I would like to explore further.
